# Introduction to Git and GitHub

## What is Git?

Git is a distributed version control system designed to track changes in source code during software development. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 2005 for development of the Linux kernel. Key features include:

- **Distributed development**: Every developer has a full copy of the repository
- **Speed and efficiency**: Most operations are performed locally
- **Data integrity**: Ensures the cryptographic integrity of every bit of your project
- **Branching and merging**: Powerful tools for non-linear development
- **Staging area**: Intermediate area for selecting and preparing changes to commit

## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a web-based hosting service for Git repositories. It provides:

- A centralized location to store and share Git repositories
- Collaboration features like pull requests and code reviews
- Issue tracking
- Project management tools
- Continuous integration and deployment tools
- Documentation hosting

## Key Differences Between Git and GitHub

| Git | GitHub |
|-----|--------|
| Version control system | Web-based hosting service for Git repositories |
| Installed locally on your computer | Cloud-based service accessed via web browser |
| Works offline | Requires internet connection |
| Free and open-source | Free for public repositories, paid plans for private repositories |
| Command-line oriented | Graphical web interface |

## Basic Terminology

- **Repository (Repo)**: A storage location where your project files and revision history are kept
- **Commit**: A snapshot of changes made to files in the repository
- **Branch**: A parallel version of the repository that allows you to work on features separately
- **Merge**: The process of combining changes from one branch into another
- **Clone**: Creating a local copy of a remote repository
- **Pull**: Fetching changes from a remote repository and merging them into your local repository
- **Push**: Sending your committed changes to a remote repository
- **Fork**: Creating a personal copy of someone else's repository on GitHub
- **Pull Request**: Proposing changes from your fork to the original repository
